# Semicolon Sound Extension

## Welcome to the SSE.

This extension is meant as a goof. It plays a sound each time you write a semicolon (;) in *VSCODE*.

You can **modify** the Soundeffect by modifying the file in media: *s-s-e_soundeffect.wav*

This project relies on **yo code**, **sound-play**, **esbuild** and **node.js**.
