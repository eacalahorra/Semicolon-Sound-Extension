# Semicolon Sound Extension
 [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Welcome to the SSE.

This extension is meant as a goof. It plays a sound each time you write a semicolon (;) in *VSCODE*.

You can **modify** the Soundeffect by modifying the file in media: *s-s-e_soundeffect.wav*

This project relies on **yo code**, **sound-play**, **esbuild** and **node.js**.

### WARNING: I am *unsure* if pasting large code could break the extension. I added a cooldown to prevent it, but testing needs to be done.
